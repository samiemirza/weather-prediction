# Weather Prediction using Linear Regression#

This is an extensive and well-documented implementation of a linear regression model using both univariate and multivariate approaches to predict the next day's maximum temperature based on various features. The provided code covers:

Data Import and Preparation:
Loading the dataset and extracting relevant features and target variables.
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
Univariate Regression:
Training a model using one feature (Present_Tmax) to predict the next day's temperature.
Implementing gradient descent for parameter optimization.
Visualizing the results with plots.
Feature Analysis:
Calculating and visualizing the correlation between different features and the target variable (Next_Tmax).
Improving Performance:
Exploring the effect of different features on the model's performance.
Multivariate Regression:
Extending the model to include multiple features.
Using gradient descent for parameter optimization.
Visualizing the cost over epochs.
Comparison with All Features:
Training a model using all available features.
Comparing the final cost values between models trained with a subset of features and all features.
Analysis:
Suggesting experiments with different learning rates and train-test split ratios to observe their impact on model performance.
